## What is a Matrix?

A **matrix** is a rectangular array of numbers or symbols arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are typically denoted by uppercase letters (e.g., $$A$$, $$B$$), and their individual elements are referred to by their position within the matrix.

### Example

Consider the following matrix $$A$$:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & 9
\end{pmatrix}
$$

This matrix has 3 rows and 3 columns, making it a **3x3 matrix**.

## Types of Matrices

Matrices can be classified based on their dimensions and characteristics:

### 1. **Row Matrix**

A matrix with only one row.

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### 2. **Column Matrix**

A matrix with only one column.

$$
B = \begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
2 \\
3
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### 3. **Square Matrix**

A matrix with the same number of rows and columns.

$$
C = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### 4. **Zero Matrix**

A matrix where all elements are zero.

$$
Z = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### 5. **Identity Matrix**

A square matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere.

$$
I = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

## Matrix Operations

Several operations can be performed on matrices, including addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

### 1. **Matrix Addition**

To add two matrices, they must have the same dimensions. The sum is obtained by adding corresponding elements.

$$
A + B = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}
5 & 6 \\
7 & 8
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
1+5 & 2+6 \\
3+7 & 4+8
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
6 & 8 \\
10 & 12
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### 2. **Matrix Subtraction**

Similar to addition, matrices must have the same dimensions. The difference is obtained by subtracting corresponding elements.

$$
A - B = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix}
5 & 6 \\
7 & 8
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
1-5 & 2-6 \\
3-7 & 4-8
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
-4 & -4 \\
-4 & -4
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### 3. **Matrix Multiplication**

Matrix multiplication is more complex. For matrices $$A$$ (size $$m \times n$$) and $$B$$ (size $$n \times p$$), the resulting matrix $$C$$ will have dimensions $$m \times p$$. The element $$c_{ij}$$ in matrix $$C$$ is computed as the dot product of the $$i$$-th row of matrix $$A$$ and the $$j$$-th column of matrix $$B$$.

$$
C = A \cdot B
$$

### Example

Consider the matrices:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{pmatrix}, \quad B = \begin{pmatrix}
5 & 6 \\
7 & 8
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The product $$C = A \cdot B$$ is calculated as follows:

$$
C = \begin{pmatrix}
(1*5 + 2*7) & (1*6 + 2*8) \\
(3*5 + 4*7) & (3*6 + 4*8)
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
19 & 22 \\
43 & 50
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### 4. **Scalar Multiplication**

This involves multiplying each element of a matrix by a scalar (a single number).

$$
kA = k \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
k*1 & k*2 \\
k*3 & k*4
\end{pmatrix}
$$

## Determinants and Inverses

### 1. **Determinant**

The determinant is a scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix. It provides important information about the matrix, including whether it is invertible.

For a 2x2 matrix:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}, \quad \text{the determinant is given by } det(A) = ad - bc.
$$

### 2. **Inverse**

The inverse of a matrix $$A$$ is denoted as $$A^{-1}$$ and is defined such that:

$$
A \cdot A^{-1} = I
$$

An inverse exists only if the determinant is non-zero.

### Example

For the matrix:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
4 & 7 \\
2 & 6
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The determinant is:

$$
det(A) = (4)(6) - (7)(2) = 24 - 14 = 10.
$$

Since the determinant is non-zero, we can find the inverse:

$$
A^{-1} = \frac{1}{det(A)} \begin{pmatrix}
d & -b \\
-c & a
\end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{10} \begin{pmatrix}
6 & -7 \\
-2 & 4
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
0.6 & -0.7 \\
-0.2 & 0.4
\end{pmatrix}
$$

## Real-World Applications of Matrices

Matrices are used extensively in various fields:

1. **Computer Graphics**: To perform transformations like rotation, translation, and scaling of images.
2. **Statistics**: In regression analysis and multivariate statistics.
3. **Physics**: To solve systems of equations in mechanics and electricity.
4. **Economics**: To represent and solve models involving multiple variables.
