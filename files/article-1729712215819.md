*Fractions are one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics, helping us understand parts of a whole and enabling us to work with non-integer values. Whether you’re dividing a pizza or calculating probabilities, mastering fractions is crucial. In this guide, we'll explore how to simplify fractions, perform basic operations, and tackle real-world problems involving fractions.*

## What is a Fraction?

A **fraction** represents a part of a whole and consists of two parts:

- **Numerator**: The top number, representing how many parts are taken.
- **Denominator**: The bottom number, representing the total number of parts.

For example, $$\frac{3}{4}$$ means 3 out of 4 equal parts.

## Types of Fractions

- **Proper Fractions**: The numerator is smaller than the denominator (e.g., $$\frac{3}{4}$$).
- **Improper Fractions**: The numerator is larger than the denominator (e.g., $$\frac{5}{3}$$).
- **Mixed Numbers**: A whole number combined with a proper fraction (e.g., $$2 \frac{1}{3}$$).

## Simplifying Fractions

To simplify a fraction, divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

Example: Simplify $$\frac{12}{16}$$.

### Step 1: Find the GCD of 12 and 16

The GCD is 4.

### Step 2: Divide both terms by the GCD

$$
\frac{12}{16} = \frac{12 \div 4}{16 \div 4} = \frac{3}{4}
$$

Thus, $$\frac{12}{16}$$ simplifies to $$\frac{3}{4}$$.

## Operations with Fractions

### 1. Addition and Subtraction

To add or subtract fractions, they must have the same denominator.

Example:

$$
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1+2}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
$$

If they have different denominators, find the least common denominator (LCD) first.

### 2. Multiplication

Multiply the numerators and denominators:

$$
\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a \times c}{b \times d}
$$

Example:

$$
\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{4}{5} = \frac{2 \times 4}{3 \times 5} = \frac{8}{15}
$$

### 3. Division

Invert the second fraction and multiply:

$$
\frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a}{b} \times \frac{d}{c}
$$

Example:

$$
\frac{3}{4} \div \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{5}{2} = \frac{15}{8}
$$

## Example Problem: Solving a Fraction Equation

Solve for $$x$$ in the equation:

$$
\frac{x}{5} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{7}{15}
$$

### Step 1: Subtract $$\frac{1}{3}$$ from both sides

$$
\frac{x}{5} = \frac{7}{15} - \frac{1}{3}
$$

Convert $$\frac{1}{3}$$ to have the same denominator as $$\frac{7}{15}$$:

$$
\frac{x}{5} = \frac{7}{15} - \frac{5}{15} = \frac{2}{15}
$$

### Step 2: Multiply both sides by 5

$$
x = 5 \times \frac{2}{15} = \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3}
$$

Thus, $$x = \frac{2}{3}$$.

## Conclusion

Fractions may seem tricky at first, but with practice and a strong grasp of basic operations, you can simplify and solve even the most complex problems with ease. Whether you’re adding, multiplying, or solving equations, understanding fractions is essential in mathematics.
