## What is a Logarithm?

At its core, a **logarithm** answers the question:

> **What power must we raise a base number to, in order to get another number?**

In mathematical terms, for a base `b` and a number `x`, the logarithm of `x` to the base `b` is defined as:

$$
\log_b(x) = y \iff b^y = x
$$

For example, if we want to find $$\log_b(x)$$, we are asking:

> "To what power must we raise `2` to get `8`?"

Since $$2^3 = 8$$, we have:

$$
\log_2(8) = 3
$$

### Common Logarithms

There are two commonly used types of logarithms:

1. **Common Logarithm** ($$\log$$) - Uses base $$10$$
    - Written as $$log(x)$$ where the base is assumed to be $$10$$.
    - Example: $$\log(100) = 2$$, because $$10^2 = 100$$.

2. **Natural Logarithm** ($$\ln$$) - Uses base $$e$$ (Euler’s number, approximately $$2.718$$)
    - Written as $$\ln(x)$$.
    - Example: $$\ln(e) = 1$$, because $$e^1 = e$$.

## Logarithm Properties

Logarithms have several important properties that simplify calculations. Let’s go over some of the most useful ones.

### 1. Product Rule

The logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the factors.

$$
\log_b(x * y) = \log_b(x) + \log_b(y)
$$

For example:

$$
\log_2(8 * 4) = \log_2(8) + \log_2(4) = 3 + 2 = 5
$$

### 2. Quotient Rule

The logarithm of a quotient is the difference of the logarithms.

$$
\log_b(x / y) = \log_b(x) - \log_b(y)
$$

Example:

$$
\log_10(100 / 10) = \log_10(100) - \log_10(10) = 2 - 1 = 1
$$

### 3. Power Rule

The logarithm of a number raised to a power is the exponent multiplied by the logarithm of the base.

$$
\log_b(x^y) = y * \log_b(x)
$$

Example:

$$
\log_2(8^2) = 2 * \log_2(8) = 2 * 3 = 6
$$

### 4. Change of Base Formula

Sometimes, you may need to compute a logarithm with a different base. The change of base formula is:

$$
\log_b(x) = \log_k(x) / \log_k(b)
$$

You can use this formula to switch to any base, but it's commonly used to switch to base 10 or base `e` to use a calculator.

Example:

$$
\log_2(16) = \frac{\log_{10}(16)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx \frac{1.204}{0.3010} \approx 4
$$

## Real-World Applications of Logarithms

Logarithms are not just abstract mathematical tools—they are used in many fields! Here are a few:
The lift coefficient ($C_L$) is a dimensionless coefficient.

- **Earthquake Intensity (Richter Scale)**: The magnitude of an earthquake is determined using a logarithmic scale. A 7.0 earthquake is 10 times more powerful than a 6.0 earthquake.
- **pH Scale in Chemistry**: The pH level is a logarithmic measure of the hydrogen ion concentration in a solution.
- **Information Theory**: Logarithms are used to calculate the amount of information and entropy in data transmission.

## Table of Logarithms of Common Numbers

| Number (x) | $$\log_10(x)$$ | $$\ln(x)$$ |
|------------|----------------|------------|
| 1          | 0              | 0          |
| 2          | 0.3010         | 0.6931     |
| 10         | 1              | 2.3026     |
| 100        | 2              | 4.6052     |
| 1000       | 3              | 6.9078     |

## Example Problem: Solving a Logarithmic Equation

Let’s solve the equation $$\log_2(x) = 5$$.

### Step 1: Convert to Exponential Form

Using the definition of logarithms, rewrite the equation:

$$
\log_2(x) = 5 ⟺ 2^5 = x
$$

### Step 2: Calculate the Value

$$
x = 32
$$

Thus, the solution is $$x = 32$$.

## Conclusion

Logarithms may seem intimidating at first, but by understanding their properties and practicing their use, you can master them! Whether you're solving equations or applying them in real-world scenarios, logarithms are a powerful mathematical tool.

Don’t forget these key properties, and you’ll be well on your way to success with logarithms!
