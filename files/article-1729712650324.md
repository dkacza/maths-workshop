*Percentages are everywhere in everyday life—from calculating discounts during sales to determining interest rates on loans. Understanding how to work with percentages is essential for making informed decisions. In this guide, we'll break down how percentages work, how to calculate them, and explore real-life scenarios where percentages are key.*

## What is a Percentage?

A **percentage** represents a fraction of 100. It is a way to express a number as a part of a whole, where the whole is represented by 100. 

For example, 50% means 50 out of 100 or half of the whole.

## Converting Between Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages

To become proficient with percentages, it's important to know how to convert between fractions, decimals, and percentages.

### 1. From Fraction to Percentage

Multiply the fraction by 100 and add the percent symbol (%).

Example:

$$
\frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75\%
$$

### 2. From Decimal to Percentage

Multiply the decimal by 100.

Example:

$$
0.25 \times 100 = 25\%
$$

### 3. From Percentage to Decimal

Divide the percentage by 100.

Example:

$$
75\% = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
$$

## Calculating Percentages

### 1. Finding a Percentage of a Number

To find a percentage of a number, multiply the number by the percentage (expressed as a decimal).

Example:

What is 20% of 80?

$$
80 \times 0.20 = 16
$$

So, 20% of 80 is 16.

### 2. Increasing/Decreasing a Number by a Percentage

To increase or decrease a number by a percentage, use the following formulas:

- **Increase**: Add the percentage to 100% and multiply.
  
  Example: Increase 50 by 10%.

  $$
  50 \times (1 + 0.10) = 50 \times 1.10 = 55
  $$

- **Decrease**: Subtract the percentage from 100% and multiply.
  
  Example: Decrease 50 by 10%.

  $$
  50 \times (1 - 0.10) = 50 \times 0.90 = 45
  $$

### 3. Finding What Percentage One Number Is of Another

To find what percentage one number is of another, divide the first number by the second and multiply by 100.

Example:

What percentage is 30 of 50?

$$
\frac{30}{50} \times 100 = 60\%
$$

## Real-Life Applications of Percentages

Percentages are crucial in a variety of real-world scenarios. Here are a few examples:

### 1. **Sales and Discounts**

When you see a 25% off sale, this means the original price is reduced by 25%. If an item costs $80, the discount is:

$$
80 \times 0.25 = 20
$$

The sale price is:

$$
80 - 20 = 60
$$

### 2. **Interest Rates**

Interest rates on loans or savings accounts are typically expressed as percentages. For example, if you have $1000 in a savings account earning 3% interest annually, the interest you earn in a year is:

$$
1000 \times 0.03 = 30
$$

### 3. **Grading Systems**

Grades are often expressed as percentages. For example, if you scored 45 out of 50 on a test, your percentage score is:

$$
\frac{45}{50} \times 100 = 90\%
$$

## Example Problem: Solving a Percentage Problem

Let’s solve the following problem:

**Problem**: A jacket is priced at $120. During a sale, it is marked down by 15%. What is the sale price?

### Step 1: Calculate the Discount

$$
120 \times 0.15 = 18
$$

### Step 2: Subtract the Discount from the Original Price

$$
120 - 18 = 102
$$

So, the sale price of the jacket is $102.

## Conclusion

Percentages are a versatile mathematical tool used in countless everyday situations. Whether you're calculating a discount, figuring out interest, or working with data, understanding percentages will help you make better decisions. Practice using the formulas and techniques outlined in this guide, and soon you'll be a percentage pro!
