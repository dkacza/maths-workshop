## What is a Function?

A **function** is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of possible outputs, where each input is related to exactly one output. Functions can be expressed in several ways: through equations, graphs, or tables.

### Notation

A function is typically written as:

$$
f(x) = y
$$

This notation means that for each input $$x$$, there is a corresponding output $$y$$.

### Example

Consider the function:

$$
f(x) = 2x + 3
$$

For an input of $$x = 4$$, the output is:

$$
f(4) = 2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
$$

## Types of Functions

Functions can be categorized into several types, each with unique characteristics:

### 1. **Linear Functions**

Linear functions have the general form:

$$
f(x) = mx + b
$$

where:
- $$m$$ is the slope,
- $$b$$ is the y-intercept.

**Example**: 

The function $$f(x) = 3x - 2$$ is linear with a slope of $$3$$ and a y-intercept of $$-2$$. Its graph is a straight line.

### 2. **Quadratic Functions**

Quadratic functions are defined by:

$$
f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
$$

where $$a \neq 0$$. Their graphs are parabolas.

**Example**:

The function $$f(x) = x^2 - 4$$ is quadratic and opens upwards, with its vertex at the point (0, -4).

### 3. **Exponential Functions**

Exponential functions have the form:

$$
f(x) = a \cdot b^x
$$

where $$a$$ is a constant, and $$b$$ is the base of the exponential.

**Example**:

The function $$f(x) = 2 \cdot 3^x$$ grows rapidly as $$x$$ increases.

### 4. **Logarithmic Functions**

Logarithmic functions are the inverses of exponential functions, expressed as:

$$
f(x) = \log_b(x)
$$

where $$b$$ is the base.

**Example**:

The function $$f(x) = \log_2(x)$$ finds the exponent to which the base $$2$$ must be raised to obtain $$x$$.

### 5. **Trigonometric Functions**

These functions relate to angles and are essential in geometry and periodic phenomena. Common trigonometric functions include:

- $$\sin(x)$$
- $$\cos(x)$$
- $$\tan(x)$$

**Example**:

The function $$f(x) = \sin(x)$$ oscillates between -1 and 1.

## Properties of Functions

Functions have several important properties that help in their analysis:

### 1. **Domain and Range**

- **Domain**: The set of all possible input values (x-values).
- **Range**: The set of all possible output values (y-values).

### Example

For the function $$f(x) = \sqrt{x}$$:
- Domain: $$x \geq 0$$ (since you cannot take the square root of a negative number).
- Range: $$y \geq 0$$.

### 2. **Intercepts**

- **Y-intercept**: The value of $$f(x)$$ when $$x = 0$$.
- **X-intercepts**: The values of $$x$$ for which $$f(x) = 0$$.

### Example

For the function $$f(x) = x^2 - 1$$:
- Y-intercept: $$f(0) = -1$$.
- X-intercepts: $$f(x) = 0 \implies x^2 - 1 = 0 \implies x = \pm1$$.

### 3. **Even and Odd Functions**

- **Even Functions**: Satisfy $$f(-x) = f(x)$$ (symmetric about the y-axis).
- **Odd Functions**: Satisfy $$f(-x) = -f(x)$$ (symmetric about the origin).

### Example

- The function $$f(x) = x^2$$ is even.
- The function $$f(x) = x^3$$ is odd.

## Real-World Applications of Functions

Functions are widely used in various real-world contexts:

1. **Physics**: Functions model motion, such as distance vs. time.
2. **Economics**: Functions help analyze costs, revenues, and profits.
3. **Biology**: Functions can model population growth and decay.
4. **Engineering**: Functions describe relationships between materials and forces.

## Example Problem: Evaluating a Function

Letâ€™s evaluate the function $$f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 1$$ for $$x = 5$$.

### Step 1: Substitute the value of $$x$$

$$
f(5) = 3(5)^2 - 2(5) + 1
$$

### Step 2: Calculate

$$
f(5) = 3(25) - 10 + 1 = 75 - 10 + 1 = 66
$$

Thus, the output is $$f(5) = 66$$.
