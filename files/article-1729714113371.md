## What is a Quadratic Equation?

A **quadratic equation** is a polynomial equation of degree two, typically written in the standard form:

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$

where:
- $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$c$$ are constants (with $$a \neq 0$$),
- $$x$$ is the variable.

### Example

Consider the quadratic equation:

$$
2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0
$$

Here, $$a = 2$$, $$b = 3$$, and $$c = -5$$.

## Solving Quadratic Equations

There are several methods to solve quadratic equations:

### 1. **Factoring**

If the quadratic can be factored, you can express it as:

$$
(ax + m)(bx + n) = 0
$$

Setting each factor to zero gives the solutions for $$x$$.

**Example**: 

For the equation $$x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$$, we can factor it as:

$$(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0$$

Thus, the solutions are:

$$
x = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 3
$$

### 2. **Using the Quadratic Formula**

The quadratic formula can be used to find the roots of any quadratic equation:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

This formula calculates the solutions based on the coefficients $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$c$$.

**Example**: 

For the equation $$2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0$$:

- $$a = 2$$, $$b = 3$$, $$c = -5$$.

Calculating the discriminant:

$$
b^2 - 4ac = 3^2 - 4(2)(-5) = 9 + 40 = 49
$$

Now apply the quadratic formula:

$$
x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2(2)} = \frac{-3 \pm 7}{4}
$$

Thus, the solutions are:

$$
x = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{-10}{4} = -2.5
$$

### 3. **Completing the Square**

This method involves rewriting the equation in the form:

$$
(x - p)^2 = q
$$

Then, taking the square root of both sides.

**Example**:

For the equation $$x^2 - 4x - 5 = 0$$, we complete the square:

1. Rearrange: $$x^2 - 4x = 5$$.
2. Add $$4$$ to both sides: $$x^2 - 4x + 4 = 9$$.
3. Factor: $$(x - 2)^2 = 9$$.
4. Take the square root: $$x - 2 = \pm 3$$.

Thus, the solutions are:

$$
x = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
$$

## Graphing Quadratic Equations

The graph of a quadratic equation is a parabola. 

### Key Features of a Parabola:

1. **Vertex**: The highest or lowest point of the parabola, depending on its orientation.
2. **Axis of Symmetry**: A vertical line that passes through the vertex, given by the formula $$x = -\frac{b}{2a}$$.
3. **Y-Intercept**: The point where the graph crosses the y-axis, found by evaluating the equation at $$x = 0$$.

**Example**:

For the equation $$y = 2x^2 + 3x - 5$$:
- The vertex can be found at $$x = -\frac{3}{2(2)} = -\frac{3}{4}$$.
- Substitute back to find the y-coordinate of the vertex.

## Real-World Applications of Quadratic Equations

Quadratic equations model various real-world situations, including:

1. **Projectile Motion**: The path of an object thrown into the air can be modeled with a quadratic equation.
2. **Area Problems**: Quadratics can be used to find dimensions of shapes with given areas.
3. **Economics**: Quadratic functions model profit and cost scenarios, helping determine maximum profit points.

## Example Problem: Solving a Quadratic Equation

Let’s solve the quadratic equation $$x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0$$ using the quadratic formula.

### Step 1: Identify coefficients

Here, $$a = 1$$, $$b = -6$$, and $$c = 8$$.

### Step 2: Calculate the discriminant

$$
b^2 - 4ac = (-6)^2 - 4(1)(8) = 36 - 32 = 4
$$

### Step 3: Apply the quadratic formula

$$
x = \frac{-(-6) \pm \sqrt{4}}{2(1)} = \frac{6 \pm 2}{2}
$$

This gives:

$$
x = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{4}{2} = 2
$$

Thus, the solutions are $$x = 4$$ and $$x = 2$$.
